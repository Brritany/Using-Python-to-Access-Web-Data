# Using-Python-to-Access-Web-Data
In this course, you will learn how to treat the Internet as a data source.  As well as scraping, parsing, and reading web data, we will also use web APIs to access data.  Python will be used to work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats.


Variables, expressions, conditional execution (loops, branches, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and file manipulation are some of the topics covered in this course.
